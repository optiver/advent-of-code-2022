Solves the problem in postscript. PS is an esoteric language in which to solve
a programming contest problem, and it is a dialect of forth, whose descendants
are well-represented within the esolang community.

You'll need a postscript engine. Fortunately, you have a lot of them! Unfortunately, the postscript engine you need also needs to be able to read stdin. Fortunately you have those too!

	$ ps2pdf 4.ps < input.txt

The answer will be written on the produced PDF, along with the input text. 

If you have ghostscript installed (OSX, maybe; Linux, almost definitely), then you could also do:

	$ gs 4.ps < input.txt

and it will draw the page to your screen.
